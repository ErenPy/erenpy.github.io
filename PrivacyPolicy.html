			<strong>
				Why does Voodoo collect data from its apps and games?
			</strong>
		</h5>
		<p>
			When you install and use Voodoo mobile applications, we can collect and process some of your data for different legitimate 
			purposes.
		</p>
		<p>
			You will find below explanations regarding the reasons why Voodoo may collect data and the legal bases Voodoo relies on 
			in each case.&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>
			Voodoo collects data:&nbsp;
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>
						To provide you with the services you asked for
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					(e.g., knowing that you completed the first level to allow access to the second one)
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Legal basis – such data processing is strictly necessary for the service(s) asked
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>
						To run analytics and understand how users interact with our product and services in order to 
						continuously improve it either directly or through third party partners
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					(e.g. identifying that a feature is annoying for users or that a level is too difficult for most gamers)
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Legal basis for third party analytics - Express consent. In the countries where collecting users’ 
							consent may be required by applicable laws and regulations, Voodoo only shares personal data 
							collected through Voodoo apps with third party partners that provide Voodoo with analytics services once 
							you express your consent through the pop-up notice included in our apps.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Legal basis for first party analytics – Legitimate interest. Voodoo collects user data for the purpose of 
							its own internal analytics tools. Data is used for the sole purpose of Voodoo analytics tool and is not shared 
							with any third parties. This data processing is based on the legitimate interest of Voodoo.
