			Buggins apps and games
		</h2>
		<h3>
			<strong>
				Why does Buggins collect data from its apps and games?
			</strong>
		</h3>
		<p>
			When you install and use Buggins mobile applications, we can collect and process some of your data for different legitimate 
			purposes.
		</p>
		<p>
			You will find below explanations regarding the reasons why Buggins may collect data and the legal bases Buggins relies on 
			in each case.&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>
			Buggins collects data:&nbsp;
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>
						To provide you with the services you asked for
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					(e.g., knowing that you completed the first level to allow access to the second one)
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Legal basis – such data processing is strictly necessary for the service(s) asked
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>
						To run analytics and understand how users interact with our product and services in order to 
						continuously improve it either directly or through third party partners
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					(e.g. identifying that a feature is annoying for users or that a level is too difficult for most gamers)
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Legal basis for third party analytics - Express consent. In the countries where collecting users’ 
							consent may be required by applicable laws and regulations, Buggins only shares personal data 
							collected through Buggins apps with third party partners that provide Buggins with analytics services once 
							you express your consent through the pop-up notice included in our apps.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Legal basis for first party analytics – Legitimate interest. Buggins collects user data for the purpose of 
							its own internal analytics tools. Data is used for the sole purpose of Buggins analytics tool and is not shared 
							with any third parties. This data processing is based on the legitimate interest of Buggins.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>
						To serve advertising tailored to the preference and interests of our users
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					and allow Buggins to continue to provide free services and products
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Legal basis – Express consent. In the countries where collecting users’ consent may be required by applicable laws 
							and regulations, Buggins only processes or shares personal data collected through Buggins apps for personalized 
							advertising purposes once you express your consent through the pop-up notice included in one of our apps.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			For all data processing activities that rely on users’ consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time from the 
			“settings” page in our various applications.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please only note that in the case where you withdraw your consent or where you refuse to consent in the first place, 
			you will still be served with advertising but that may be less relevant to you as it will not be tailored to your interests.
		</p>
		<p>
		</p>
